# Generating XML
Use the class `Invoice` to generate Factur-X XML.

When generating XML, this library doesn't perform any type of calculation so you should provide all the needed data.

## Models
Invoice related properties are grouped in sub-classes:
- Seller
- Buyer
- Delivery
- ...etc

## Data types
- Numbers: `float` type with 2 decimal points.
- Dates: a `DateTime` object, will be converted to format 102 (`Ymd`).

## Usage of Enums
Enums have been implemented for specific properties where the list of known values is relatively small, with a fallback to a string for values not included in the enum. When the documentation specifies a comprehensive list of available options, enums have been created to include all those options and in this case you should use enums.

## Create an invoice instance
See [4.invoice properties](documentation/4.invoice%20properties.md) for the list of properties.
```php
use MahdiAbderraouf\FacturX\Models\Invoice;

// Create an invoice from an array
$invoice = Invoice::createFromArray([
    'profile' => Profile::BASIC,
    'seller' => [
        //
    ],
    'buyer' => [
        //
    ],
    // ...
]);

// Or, using constructor directly
$seller = new Seller(...);
$buyer = new Buyer(...);
$invoice = new Invoice(
    seller: $seller,
    buyer: $buyer,
    ...
);
```

## Examples
Examples of how to build XML for every profile are available in the folder [examples](examples).
