# Generating Factur-X PDf
Using the static method `Generator::generate` you can embed an XML into a PDF file to generate a Factur-X file.

To ensure the integrity of every Factur-X file, the XML is validated before being embedded, so there is no need to validate it beforehand.

## About attachment relationship
The ISO 19005-3 specification allows 5 types of attachment relationship:
- Data: the embedded XML file contains data used in the PDF file
- Source: the PDF file has been built from the XML file
- Alternative: the XML file is an alternative representation of the PDF file
- Supplement: the embedded file contains extra data
- Unspecified: no relationship specified

Please note about attachment relationship:
- The only relationships that can be used for the XML file are `Data`, `Source` and `Alternative`.
- In Germany the only relationship allowed is `Alternative`.
- For profiles `minimum` and `basicwl` only the relationship `Data` is allowed.
- It is not recommanded to use the relationship `UNSPECIFIED` when adding additional attachments.

## Factur-X Profile
If you are generating invoices in Germany, the profiles `minimum` and `basicwl` are not considered legally as an invoice since they don't contain enough information. Same rule will be applied in France in the future so you should be using at least the `basic` profile.

## Generate Factur-X PDF
```php
use MahdiAbderraouf\FacturX\Enums\Profile;
use MahdiAbderraouf\FacturX\Exceptions\InvalidXmlException;
use MahdiAbderraouf\FacturX\Generator;

$profile = Profile::BASIC;
$invoice = Invoice::createFromArray([...]);

try {
    $pdfString = Generator::generate(
        // path or PDF string
        '/path/to/Invoice.pdf',
        // Invoice, XML string or path
        $invoice,

        // optional
        AttachmentRelationship::DATA, // default one
        'outputPath.pdf',
        Profile::BASIC, // validates against a specific profile
        // add more attachments if needed
        [
            [
                'file' => 'extra_file.txt',
                // optional
                'filename' => 'Extra file name', // Defaults to the given file name
                'relationship' => AttachmentRelationship::SUPPLEMENT, // Defaults to AttachmentRelationship::UNSPECIFIED when not present
                'description' => 'This is some extra file description',
            ]
        ]
    );
} catch (InvalidXmlException $e) {
    $errors = $e->getErrors();
}
```
